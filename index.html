    <p> 
        <span class="keyword">Iceland</span> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. 
        Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun.

            <p>
                The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, 
                and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland 
                is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow. <br>
                The Aurora Borealis ,more commonly reffered to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon 
                created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic 
                field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies

                When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake-namely, 
                its 4,500 square mailes of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes places mainly
                on the Solhimajokull and Svinafellasjokull glaciers in the south of icelance to which day trips are 
                offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).

        <h3 class="newsHeadline">Hollywood Reporter and Screen Daily gave Icelandic Director Elfar Aoalsteinsson great reviews</h3>
        <p class="newsBody">
            nd of Sentence, by director Elfar Aðalsteins, receives very positive reviews in leading film industry magazines 
            such as Hollywood Reporter and Screen Daily, which picked it one of five buzzy titles from the Edinburgh 
            International Film Festival which finished last weekend.
            The film’s two leading actors, John Hawkes and Logan Lerman, are also praised in both reviews.
             Hawkes has quite a few films under his belt and was nominated for an Oscar for Winter’s Bones 
             and young Lerman is best known for his role in The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Icelandic actor 
             Ólafur Darri Ólafsson also has a small part in End of Sentence.
